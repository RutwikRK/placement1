                    <p>In today’s world Information Technology (IT) has become the most fundamental need for proper functioning of human society. Be it running the banks or getting food from an eatery home-delivered, Information Technology has become the part and parcel of our lives. This dependence on Information Technology has given rise to the demand of learning and further innovation in this field as a result of which it has become one of the most popular fields in education and career. You can find IT specialization in every branch of education, from IT & Software, Engineering, Aviation and Medicine to MBA and even Hospitality.
                        n this technological era, the best career option for students in present and immediate future is to become an Information Technology (IT) professional. Apart from industrial and high-risk tasks, every small day-to-day activity is now governed and performed with the help of IT
                        Most people confuse IT courseswith Computer Science. Computer Science is the study of aspects of computing, starting from the design of microprocessors, personal and supercomputers to designing circuits and writing codes for the software that powers these machines, whereas Information Technology deals with the regulation and security of data through electronic devices and its related software.
