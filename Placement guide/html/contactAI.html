                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as the technology that uses computer and their applications to model and/or replicate human behaviour and thought processes. It includes learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction.

                        Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots.
                        
                        Artificial intelligence (AI) and Robotics along with Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT) form a powerful combination for automating tasks inside and outside of the factory setting.</p>
